# House-prices-linear-regression
Problem Statement:

- Ask a home buyer to describe their dream home, and they probably won't start with the basement ceiling height or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this competition's dataset proves that these factors have a much bigger impact on price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white picket fence.
With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) all aspects of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final sale price of each home.
